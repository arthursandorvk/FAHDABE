# FAHDABE
This project gives the complete source code in C of our paper FAHDABE. We design a novel approach to hide attributes in access policy and guarantee attribute hiding (weak attribute hiding) using additive homomorphic hashing. Our construction supports any implementation of additive hashing. Our work leverages LTHash as Additive homomorphic hash function.
