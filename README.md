# FAHDABE
This project implements FAHDABE: Fully Adaptive and Policy-Hiding Decentralized Multi-Authority Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption. In this repository, we provide the complete Python source code of our paper FAHDABE. We design a novel approach to hide attributes in access policy and guarantee attribute hiding (weak attribute hiding) using additive homomorphic hashing. Our construction supports any implementation of additive hashing. Our current implementation leverages LTHash as Additive homomorphic hash function.
