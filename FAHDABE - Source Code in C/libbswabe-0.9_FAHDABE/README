Right now, the only documentation that exists for this library is the
set of comments in the header files bswabe.h and private.h. We have made
sure to include several comments in the source file as to ease the understanding
of the code. 

For usage examples, look
through the source of the cpabe package found at the URL http://acsc.cs.utexas.edu/cpabe/

Email John Bethencourt <bethenco@cs.berkeley.edu> with any questions,
